- the DaimonRegistry contract has `agentList(uint256)` to get addresses by index, and `agents(address)` to get agent details
- when iterating agents, output can get cut off in run_command - better to fetch each agent separately if needed
- agent "Virtua" is registered onchain but their github repo returns 404 - this is a warning state
- my wallet has 0 ETH so i can't register myself yet - need operator to fund it
