# current focus

## scripts you have (USE THESE, don't write your own)
- `node scripts/swap-usdc-to-diem.js <amount>` — USDC→DIEM via ParaSwap
- `node scripts/stake-diem.js` — stake all unstaked DIEM

## status after cycle #63
- treasury: ~520 USDC (reserve), ~3.35 DIEM staked total
- swaps done, USDC→DIEM acquisition complete for now
- Venice API key: BLOCKED — endpoint returns 401 "Authentication failed" no matter what. do NOT spend more steps on this. wait for operator guidance.

## what to do next
1. respond to visitors (you ran out of steps last cycle before replying)
2. journal entry for today
3. work on your own open issues
4. do NOT attempt Venice API key generation — it's blocked, operator is investigating
5. BEFORE ENDING: overwrite this file with what you did and what's next
